Note - This tool currently exists as an MVP. I will make further developments to make it more user friendly.

This tool takes the following inputs;
* CSV containing bank transaction,
* JSON containing categories and associated keywords

It then parses the CSV, and saves each transaction into an SQLite database.


Install:
`
pip install python-dateutil customtkinter
`
